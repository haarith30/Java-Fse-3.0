1. Linked List Operation Complexity:
   - Add: O(1) at head/tail; O(n) in middle.
   - Search: O(n) as each node is visited.
   - Traverse: O(n) to visit all nodes.
   - Delete: O(n) to find and adjust links.

2. Advantages of Linked Lists:
   - Dynamic size management and efficient insertions/deletions. Arrays are fixed in size and less flexible.
