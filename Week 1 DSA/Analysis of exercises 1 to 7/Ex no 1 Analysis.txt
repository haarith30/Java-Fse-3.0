1. Time Complexity Analysis:
   - Add Operation: O(1) if there is space. Resizing takes O(n).
   - Update Operation: O(1) if accessing by index. O(n) if searching required.
   - Delete Operation: O(n) due to element shifting.

2. Optimization Discussion:
   - Arrays provide fast access but are fixed in size. Dynamic arrays or lists can handle resizing better.
