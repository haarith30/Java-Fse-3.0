1. Recursive Algorithm Time Complexity:
   - Naive Recursion (e.g., Fibonacci): O(2^n). Exponential complexity.

2. Optimization Methods:
   - Memoization: Reduces complexity to O(n) by storing results of subproblems.
   - Dynamic Programming: Provides O(n) time complexity by iteratively solving subproblems.
