1. Operation Time Complexity:
   - Add: O(1) if space available; O(n) for resizing.
   - Search: O(n) due to linear scan.
   - Traverse: O(n) to visit all elements.
   - Delete: O(n) due to shifting elements.

2. Array Limitations:
   - Fixed size and costly resizing. Linked lists are better for dynamic sizes and efficient insertions/deletions.
